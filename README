Introduction

muhttpd (mu HTTP deamon) is a simple but versatile web server written in 
portable ANSI C. It supports static pages, CGI scripts, and MIME type 
based handlers. It drops privileges before accepting any connections, and 
it can log received requests. Development emphasis is on simplicity, 
small size, and security. It has been tested on GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, 
FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Cygwin. It compiles and runs on 32 bits and 64 
bits, little endian and big endian systems.

Various features can be disabled at compile time, making the resulting 
binary even simpler, smaller, and probably more secure.

muhttpd has seen rapid development in early 2004, and is now a very 
stable product.

Installation

./configure
