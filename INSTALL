Quick Start

Basically, building and installation is as simple as:

./configure
make
make install

This will build muhttpd with all features enabled, and install to 
/usr/local. The rest of this document discusses how to customize building
and installation.

Configuration

The configure script accepts the following options:

--prefix <path>
	Use <path> as the installation prefix (default: /usr/local)

--disable-<feature>
	Do not include <feature>. <feature> can be one of background, cgi,
	handlers, logging, mime, pidfile, and setuid. handlers requires mime.

--enable-<feature>
	Include <feature>. See --disable-<feature> for more info.

--disable-all
	Disable all features. Individual features can still be enabled 
	with --enable-<feature>.

--enable-all
	Enable all features. Individual features can be disabled with
	--disable-feature.

--with-clearenv
	Use the included clearenv implementation. This is required on 
	systems that do not provide the clearenv function. It is 
	enabled by default, as it is mostly harmless on systems that do 
	provide clearenv.

--without-clearenv
	Do not use the included clearenv implementation. On systems that 
	provide clearenv, this can be used to generate a slightly smaller 
	muhttpd binay

--with-libgen
	Link against libgen. This is required on Cygwin, which does not 
	provide basename and dirname as part of the C library.

--without-libgen
	Do not link aganist libgen. This is the default, as most systems 
	provide the required functionality in libc.

--with-strndup
	Use the included strndup implementation. This is enabled by 
	default, because strndup is not a standard function and most C 
	libraries do not provide it.

--without-strndup
	Do not use the included strndup implementation. This can be used 
	to create a slightly smaller muhttpd binary on systems that 
	provide strndup, such as GNU systems.

Compiling

To start compilation, type make. Both GNU make and BSD make should work, 
other versions of make may not work.

Installing

To perform a regular installation, type make install. You can modify the 
installation prefix by setting the PREFIX environment variable. E.g.

env PREFIX=./fake make install

installs muhttpd to ./fake instead of the prefix specified to configure. 
This can be used for staging installs, as performed by many packaging 
systems.
